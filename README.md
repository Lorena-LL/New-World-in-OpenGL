# New World in OpenGL

## Description
**New World in OpenGL** is an interactive 3D neighborhood scene built using OpenGL. The project allows users to explore the environment freely or take a guided tour. The scene includes various 3D models (.obj format) sourced from platforms like TurboSquid and Sketchfab. Some models required texture corrections, which were done using Blender.

The project is developed in **Visual Studio**, utilizing **shadow mapping**, **fragment discarding**, and lighting models like **Blinn-Phong Lighting** to enhance realism.

## Features
- **Free Movement**: Walk around and explore the scene.
- **Guided Tour**: Automatic navigation through the environment.
- **Lighting Effects**: Toggle point lights for enhanced realism.
- **Multiple Rendering Modes**: Wireframe, solid, and polygonal views.
- **Mouse Camera Control**: Adjust the camera’s inclination.

## Controls
- **Arrow Up (↑)** – Move camera up
- **Arrow Down (↓)** – Move camera down
- **W** – Move camera forward
- **S** – Move camera backward
- **A** – Move camera left
- **D** – Move camera right
- **Q** – Rotate scene left
- **E** – Rotate scene right
- **F** – Switch between wireframe, solid, and polygonal rendering
- **L** – Toggle point lights
- **T** - Start automated tour
- **Mouse Movement** – Control camera inclination

## For Users 
To run the project, download the necessary files from the **For_Users** folder. If you are only interested in running the simulation without modifying the code, simply execute the provided binaries.

## For those interested in the code
In the folder Lab2_project you can find the .cpp and .hpp files with the code.

#### Requirements
- **Visual Studio** (for development)
- **OpenGL & GLUT**
- **Blender** (optional, for model adjustments)

## Acknowledgments
I completed the project under the guidance of the teachers at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca.
